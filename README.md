## The game<a id="sec-1-1" name="sec-1-1"></a>

### Introduction<a id="sec-1-1-1" name="sec-1-1-1"></a>

Create your player to fight other students on the world famous (or infamous) Filler board. The concept is simple: two players gain points by placing on a board, one after the other, the game piece obtained by the game master (in the form of an executable Ruby program). The game ends when the game piece cannot be placed anymore. Have fun!

# Goals<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

The goal of this project is to introduce you to basic algorithm and to have you manipulate inputs/outputs.
